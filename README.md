Built a Congestion Prediction model which can predict and prevent 
congestion at peak hours by 15-20% by changing Bus routes’ layout in 
several states, as measured by the Geom data given by buses at 
regular intervals. 
 Used MY SQL and Cassandra for data storing and usage, and 
established connection of databases’ servers with cloud-based 
notebooks. 
 Deployed the model as a Web-app for better user interaction through 
flask and ngrock.
